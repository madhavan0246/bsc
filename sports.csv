You might love playing, but turning it into a career takes a crazy amount of time, money, and dedication. Only a small percentage of people ever get the chance to go pro, and for most, it feels too risky compared to choosing a safer, more stable career. Add to that things like family pressure, the fear of injuries, and how tough the competition is, and a lot of people end up keeping sports as a passion rather than a profession."

Constantly having to perform under high expectations can take a serious toll on an athlete’s mental health. On top of that, not everyone has the financial support to invest in their sports career, especially when the early years don’t guarantee any stable income. Injuries are another huge factor. once an athlete gets hurt, even after recovery, the fear of re-injury holds them back. What we really lack in India is awareness and support around sports psychology. There’s still a huge gap in helping athletes recover mentally, not just physically. I believe if the government introduced dedicated schemes that support students and athletes who represent the country, it would go a long way in helping more young talents pursue sports seriously."

finding the talent where the person may be talented but may not focused towards it or may not got a chance the system should be more clearer from the bottom (schools,colleges) where every sports to the most like more than cricket,football there are multiple sports not everyone can be fitted in the same sport the government should encourage the sports in the school and make every sport available in every town so the exposure can be more and then it is not easy I know but the government if wishes can do it and also if a person has a good potential in a sport and he /she is financially weak they should be given a specific quota and scholarship or sponsered through the help of government so it can be helpful for them."

I said no then they asked if u don't then how all of sudden i know about football, i just know very limited  etc.. 
Being girl or boy , first parent or family and then ,for women specially  society  break the  confidence  to choose sports as career saying  ' it's not for people like us' , i also heard  that those who plays sports, their character isn't  good ( they meant those scandals of famous players).. idk why they said this and still  watches the match and following them.."

At the professional level, sports require immense commitment, discipline, and years of rigorous practice, yet only a small fraction of athletes actually succeed. Many give up because of:

Economic uncertainty: 
        Unlike conventional careers, sports rarely guarantee steady income or long-term security unless one reaches the highest ranks.

Intense competition :
       Millions participate, but only a select few manage to qualify for elite positions.

Physical strain and injury risks:
        A single accident can abruptly end an athlete’s career.

Parental and social expectations: 
         Most families urge young people to choose “safer” career paths such as medicine, engineering, or business."

The biggest reason most don’t go pro is that the path is extremely narrow: only a tiny fraction of players have the rare mix of talent, physical durability, mental toughness, financial support, and timing needed to reach an elite level.

Even skilled athletes often face obstacles like limited access to high-quality coaching or facilities, the cost of training and travel, pressure to focus on academics or a more stable job, and the risk of injury ending their chances. Because the odds of making a living are so small and the sacrifices so large, many decide it’s more practical to keep sports as a passion or hobby rather than a career.
